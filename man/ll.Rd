\title{Calculates factor of log-likelihood independent of the data.
We assume that the data are distributed according to a normal distribution of mean m, standard
deviation s, truncated at lower and upper limits, ul and uh, respectively.}

ll(.mean, .sd, ul, uh, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{.mean}{Mean of normal distribution.}

\item{.sd}{Standard deviation of normal distribution.}

\item{ul}{Unstandardized lower truncation limit.}

\item{uh}{Unstandardized upper truncation limit.}

\item{n}{Number of observations.}
